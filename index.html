    <p class="King">
      <strong> King of wrath: </strong> She’s the wife he never wanted…and the
      weakness he never saw coming. Ruthless. Meticulous. Arrogant. Dante Russo
      thrives on control, both personally and professionally. The billionaire
      CEO never planned to marry— until the threat of blackmail forces him into
      an engagement with a woman he barely knows. Vivian Lau, jewelry heiress
      and daughter of his newest enemy. It doesn’t matter how beautiful or
      charming she is. He’ll do everything in his power to destroy the evidence
      and their betrothal. There’s only one problem: now that he has her…he
      can’t bring himself to let her go. *** Elegant. Ambitious. Well-mannered.
      Vivian Lau is the perfect daughter and her family’s ticket into the
      highest echelons of high society. Marrying a blue-blooded Russo means
      opening doors that would otherwise remain closed to her new-money family.
      While the rude, elusive Dante isn’t her idea of a dream partner, she
      agrees to their arranged marriage out of duty. Craving his touch was never
      part of the plan. Neither was the worst thing she could possibly do: fall
      in love with her future husband. <br />
      <strong> King of pride: </strong> For a forbidden romance, this was pretty
      mellow. I just craved more drama and high stakes. Everything just seemed
      status quo and slide into place almost too easily. That allowed for some
      great moments of communication between Kai and Isabella so I can’t be too
      mad. I never want drama just for the sake of it but in this case, I just
      needed something to take it to the next level and challenge these
      characters a little more. <br />
      <strong> King of Greed: </strong> This romance had a vibe unlike anything
      I’ve read before. It was a different spin on a second chance romance: can
      you save a broken marriage? Most of the time, in the romances I read at
      least, the marriage hasn’t happened when the fissure comes so it was a
      refreshing situation to watch these characters navigate and grow from.
      Another challenge with this setup is that these characters have already
      established a love story, one the reader hasn’t been privy to before. But
      we get enough flashbacks to the start of their relationship interspersed
      with current events to make you see how perfect they are for each other.
      <br />
      <strong> King of sloth: </strong> Wow, king of slow was right. This book
      moved at a glacial pace trying to set up their character backstories. I
      enjoy a good slow burn romance so I normally wouldn’t mind, but I didn’t
      even see the chemistry happening between them at all. And I just didn’t
      connect with their individual characters either. Maybe one day I’ll try
      again but I was reading it in Kindle Unlimited and I had other books I
      wanted to get to.

      Arc of a scythe series <br />

    <p class="Scythe">
      This whole series is about a world with no hunger, no disease, no war, no
      misery: humanity has conquered all those things, and has even conquered
      death. Now Scythes are the only ones who can end life—and they are
      commanded to do so, in order to keep the size of the population under
      control. Citra and Rowan are chosen to apprentice to a scythe—a role that
      neither wants. These teens must master the “art” of taking life, knowing
      that the consequence of failure could mean losing their own. <br />

      <strong> Scythe: </strong> This is the book that introduces the series and
      helps us understand this world of technology. <br />
      <strong> Thunderhead: </strong> This is the BEST book of the series
      because so much happens. Spolier alert: Goddard(the villan) and Scythe
      Rand(his sidekick) come back to life and devise a plan to take over the
      scythedom. <br />
      <strong> The Toll: </strong> This second to last book of the series sums
      up everything bad that occured in the thunderhead, sadly a lot of people
      die because of Goddard. However, it does have a warm happy ending.
